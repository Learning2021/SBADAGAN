SBADA-GAN CVPR 2018 code
This is a preliminary release, as the code needs a massive cleanup being extremely verbose in this current state.
In the Mnist_MnistM notebook can be found an example of how to run SBADA-GAN on Mnist -> MnistM Domain Adaptation task.

To be added: datasets files in npy format as needed by the algorithm

There is a nice porting of SBADA-GAN to Pytorch that produce similar results on several experiments:

Finally, in the next days I will release my Pytorch version too, that is meant to become the standard SBADA-GAN source code written in
a clear and readable format.
